        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hi! I'm Lily. I'm a super duper newbie web developer. I enjoy the challenge of figuring 
            things out with little to no experience, including yoga, philosophy, and assembling Ikea furniture.
            Now that I have my 200-hour yoga teaching certification, a master's degree in Philosophy, and
            a cute Ikea nightstand, I set my sights on learning Web Development. I currently work at an academic publisher in Philadelphia, where I manage five review journals that publish research in clinical medicine and sustainable/renewable energy.  
            If I continue in publishing, I would like to work with Humanities scholarship. 
            I am hoping to apply the technical skills I learn in this course to an academic field, such as Digital Humanities.
        </p>
